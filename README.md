## Main objective

  - Make a Web application for finding available bicycles, using open data from the bicycle sharing systems of many cities.

  - Link the data with other data sources, such as information on the public transport systems or touristic data.

## Pedagogical objectives

  - Do a little software development, using Semantic Web programming frameworks
  - Setup and interact with an RDF database
  - Exploit multiple sources of heterogeneous data
